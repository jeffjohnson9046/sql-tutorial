# Basic Exercises with `sqlc` Using Go

This repo is a playground for experimenting with `sqlc`.  It was started by
following the [**Getting Started with PostgresSQL**](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/tutorials/getting-started-postgresql.html)
and built up from there.  Right now there's not much to it, but as time permits
additional scenarios will be added.  Soon some other stuff will be changed.
